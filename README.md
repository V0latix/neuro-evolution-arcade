# Neuro Evolution Arcade

Neuro Evolution Arcade is a browser playground for training small neural
networks to play arcade-style games through neuroevolution.

The current games are Flappy Bird and Lunar Lander Lite. The long-term
direction is to add more games that reuse the same learning loop: observe game
state, decide an action, score fitness, select the strongest agents, cross over
their networks, mutate weights, and run a new generation.

## Current Games

The app currently runs entirely in the browser and includes:

- Canvas-based Flappy Bird and Lunar Lander Lite simulations
- A game picker that separates game-specific controls and explanations
- Populations of neural-network-controlled agents
- Fitness scoring, elite preservation, crossover, and mutation
- Generation-by-generation training
- Live metrics and a neural-network visualizer for the current champion
- Flappy Bird with six inputs, including the following pipe gap
- Lunar Lander Lite with eight inputs for position, velocity, angle, fuel, pad
  distance, and spin, plus thrust/left/right outputs
- Human play mode with the space bar for Flappy Bird and space plus arrows/A/D
  for Lunar Lander
- Local champion save/load via browser storage
- Flappy Bird difficulty presets for gap, spacing, speed, and mutation
- Lunar-specific sliders for gravity, initial fuel, platform size, and engine
  power

## Game Modules

`Flappy Bird` trains flying agents. The network observes height, vertical
velocity, obstacle distance, the current gap, and the next gap. The output is a
single flap decision.

`Lunar Lander Lite` trains agents to land a small craft on a platform. The
network observes horizontal position, altitude, horizontal and vertical speed,
angle, fuel, distance to the landing pad, and spin. Its outputs control main
thrust, rotation left, and rotation right. Each specimen can replay up to five
attempts inside the same generation, stopping early when it lands successfully.
The visible score is the total number of successful landings in the generation.
Fitness is cumulative across all attempts, so a specimen is selected for both
landing success and useful partial behavior: moving toward the pad, slowing
descent, staying upright, and saving fuel.

## Next Game Ideas

Strong candidates for future modules after Lunar:

- `Dino Runner`: close to the Flappy flow, but with jump timing and obstacle
  type recognition.
- `Car Avoider`: lane changes, obstacle timing, and bonus/risk tradeoffs.
- `2048`: useful for testing strategy and delayed reward, though better suited
  to tree search or reinforcement learning hybrids.
- `Tetris Mini`: interesting but harder; requires board evaluation, rotation,
  placement choice, and longer-term planning.

Recommended order:

1. `Dino Runner`, because it reuses much of the current side-scroller logic.
2. `Car Avoider`, because it introduces multiple simultaneous choices without
   becoming too hard to visualize.
3. `Grid Collector`, because it can show path planning, reward tradeoffs, and
   local traps clearly.

## Run Locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Test Before Push

Run the full local validation suite:

```bash
npm run check
```

It checks JavaScript syntax and covers the main app flows in a simulated browser
environment.

## Controls

- `Pause` / `Resume`: stop or continue the simulation
- `Next gen`: force evolution into the next generation
- `Reset`: restart the current mode
- `Simulation speed`: run more physics steps per animation frame in AI mode
- `Population` and `Mutation`: change the training setup and restart. Defaults
  are 10 birds and a 0.10 mutation rate.
- `Passage tuyaux`: change the vertical opening between the upper and lower pipe
- `Espacement tuyaux`: change the horizontal distance between consecutive pipes
  These pipe controls are only visible for Flappy Bird.
- `Human play`: switch to manual play, then press `Space` to flap
- `Gravite`: change Lunar Lander gravity and restart Lunar training
- `Fuel initial`: change Lunar Lander starting fuel and restart Lunar training
- `Taille plateforme`: change the Lunar landing platform width
- `Puissance moteur`: change Lunar Lander thrust strength
- `Save` / `Load` / `Clear`: manage the best saved champion in local browser
  storage
- `Preset difficulte`: apply easy, normal, hard, or chaos training settings

This project intentionally uses simple geometric canvas art instead of
copyrighted game assets.
