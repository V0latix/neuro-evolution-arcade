# Neuro Evolution Arcade

Neuro Evolution Arcade is a browser playground for training small neural
networks to play arcade-style games through neuroevolution.

The first available game is a Flappy-style pipe runner. Snake is now available
as the second game. The long-term direction is to add more games that reuse the
same learning loop: observe game state, decide an action, score fitness, select
the strongest agents, cross over their networks, mutate weights, and run a new
generation.

## Current Games

The app currently runs entirely in the browser and includes:

- Canvas-based Pipe Runner and Snake simulations
- A game picker that separates game-specific controls and explanations
- Populations of neural-network-controlled agents
- Fitness scoring, elite preservation, crossover, and mutation
- Generation-by-generation training
- Live metrics and a neural-network visualizer for the current champion
- Pipe Runner with six inputs, including the following pipe gap
- Snake with ten inputs and three actions: turn left, continue, turn right
- Sequential Snake evaluation: one specimen plays a full run, then the next
  specimen starts its own run
- Human play mode with the space bar for Pipe Runner and arrows/WASD for Snake
- Local champion save/load via browser storage
- Pipe Runner difficulty presets for gap, spacing, speed, and mutation
- Snake-specific controls for grid size and food patience

## Game Modules

`Pipe Runner` trains flying agents. The network observes height, vertical
velocity, obstacle distance, the current gap, and the next gap. The output is a
single flap decision.

`Snake` trains grid agents. The network observes immediate danger straight
ahead, left, and right; food direction relative to the snake; open space in
those same directions; and length. The outputs select one of three relative
moves: left, forward, or right. Snake specimens are evaluated one at a time so
each agent gets a separate board, food sequence, and fitness score.

## Next Game Ideas

Strong candidates for future modules after Snake:

- `Pong`: simple physics, continuous paddle control, easy to compare AI vs
  human.
- `Breakout`: adds planning through brick layouts, ball angle, and survival.
- `Dino Runner`: close to the Flappy flow, but with jump timing and obstacle
  type recognition.
- `Lunar Lander Lite`: more advanced continuous control with fuel, velocity,
  rotation, and landing fitness.
- `2048`: useful for testing strategy and delayed reward, though better suited
  to tree search or reinforcement learning hybrids.
- `Tetris Mini`: interesting but harder; requires board evaluation, rotation,
  placement choice, and longer-term planning.

Recommended order:

1. `Pong`, because it introduces opponent/player comparison.
2. `Dino Runner`, because it reuses much of the current side-scroller logic.
3. `Breakout`, because it adds richer physics and level state.
4. `Lunar Lander Lite`, because it pushes toward continuous control.

## Run Locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Test Before Push

Run the full local validation suite:

```bash
npm run check
```

It checks JavaScript syntax and covers the main app flows in a simulated browser
environment.

## Controls

- `Pause` / `Resume`: stop or continue the simulation
- `Next gen`: force evolution into the next generation
- `Reset`: restart the current mode
- `Simulation speed`: run more physics steps per animation frame in AI mode
- `Population` and `Mutation`: change the training setup and restart. Defaults
  are 10 birds and a 0.10 mutation rate.
- `Passage tuyaux`: change the vertical opening between the upper and lower pipe
- `Espacement tuyaux`: change the horizontal distance between consecutive pipes
- `Human play`: switch to manual play, then press `Space` to flap
- `Snake`: use arrows or WASD in human mode
- `Taille grille`: change the Snake board size
- `Patience nourriture`: change how long Snake agents may survive without food
- `Specimen speed`: in Snake, run more steps per frame while still testing one
  specimen at a time
- `Save` / `Load` / `Clear`: manage the best saved champion in local browser
  storage
- `Preset difficulte`: apply easy, normal, hard, or chaos training settings

This project intentionally uses simple geometric canvas art instead of
copyrighted game assets.
