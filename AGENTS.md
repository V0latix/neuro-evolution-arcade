# AGENTS.md

## Project

Neuro Evolution Arcade is a static browser app for training neural-network
agents on small arcade games through neuroevolution. It currently includes
Flappy Bird and Lunar Lander Lite, and the codebase should continue evolving as
a multi-game lab.

The app has no build step and no runtime dependencies. It is served directly
from `index.html`, `src/main.js`, and `src/styles.css`.

## Commands

Run this before every commit or push:

```bash
npm run check
```

This command runs:

- `node --check src/main.js`
- `npm test`

The test suite lives in `test/app.test.mjs` and uses Node's built-in
`node:test` runner with a lightweight DOM/canvas mock.

## Repository Layout

- `index.html`: app structure, controls, and explanatory content
- `src/main.js`: shared neuroevolution loop, game profiles, human mode,
  localStorage champion management, presets, and canvas drawing
- `src/styles.css`: responsive layout and control styling
- `test/app.test.mjs`: regression tests for the main app flows
- `README.md`: user-facing documentation and game roadmap

## Implementation Rules

- Keep the app dependency-free unless a feature clearly requires a package.
- Preserve static hosting compatibility. The app must still work by opening
  `index.html` or serving the folder with a static file server.
- Keep edits scoped. Avoid unrelated refactors when adding gameplay or UI
  features.
- Use ASCII in source files unless a file already requires non-ASCII text.
- If changing `src/main.js`, update or add tests in `test/app.test.mjs`.
- If adding a new control in `index.html`, add coverage that proves the control
  exists and affects app state.
- If changing neural-network shape, update:
  - `INPUTS`, `HIDDEN`, or genome sizing in `src/main.js`
  - network labels in `INPUT_LABELS`
  - champion compatibility tests
  - explanatory text in `index.html` and `README.md`

## Multi-Game Direction

Future games should be added as game profiles or modules with clear
boundaries:

- Game state and physics
- Agent input vector
- Action mapping
- Fitness function
- Rendering
- Human-control adapter, when applicable
- Tests for boot, controls, scoring, and reset behavior

Avoid hard-coding game-specific concepts into shared neuroevolution logic when
adding the next game. Flappy Bird and Lunar Lander Lite each define their own
observation vector, action mapping, fitness function, rendering, human controls,
and champion storage keys.

## Gameplay Notes

- AI training mode uses generations, fitness, selection, crossover, and
  mutation.
- Human play mode is intentionally one physics step per animation frame, even
  when the AI speed slider is higher. This keeps keyboard control playable.
- Game switching resets the current run and activates only the selected game's
  settings and explanation panel.
- Pipe gap and pipe spacing reset the current run so one generation is not
  scored across mixed difficulty settings.
- Lunar Lander Lite uses a dedicated settings panel for gravity, initial fuel,
  platform size, and engine power. The gravity slider is expressed as a fraction
  of Earth gravity, so the default Moon-like value is `0.17g`. These controls
  must be hidden for Flappy Bird, and changing them should reset Lunar training.
- Flappy Bird pipe controls (`pipeSettings`, `pipeGap`, `pipeSpacing`, and
  `presetPanel`) must be visible only for Flappy Bird. Lunar should never show
  pipe sliders.
- Lunar Lander Lite has eight inputs (`x`, `altitude`, `vx`, `vy`, `angle`,
  `fuel`, `pad dx`, `spin`) and three outputs (`thrust`, `left`, `right`).
  Lunar uses sequential evaluation with a shared per-generation target
  sequence. One specimen plays at a time, starts from target index 0, and keeps
  playing after a successful landing: score and fitness increase, the platform
  advances to the next target in the sequence, and the lander restarts from the
  same deterministic centered state. Crashing or timing out ends that
  specimen's turn; the next specimen restarts at target index 0 of the same
  sequence and the same initial state. The displayed score and best score are
  the best individual specimen score observed in the current generation, never
  the sum of all specimen scores. Fitness is also optimized per specimen: keep
  maximizing the strongest individual `agent.fitness`, not a generation-wide
  sum. Landers should spawn from the center of the simulation, while pads may
  appear across the full visible width. Target-oriented fitness rewards are
  multiplied by pad difficulty, so reaching or landing on edge targets is worth
  more than doing the same on a central target. Do not multiply generic
  survival/stability by pad difficulty; otherwise agents learn to drift toward
  edges. Penalize wrong-way horizontal velocity and wall-hugging away from the
  target. Lunar approach rewards must be based on horizontal pad-distance
  reduction, not diagonal distance reduction, because diagonal distance shrinks
  when a lander simply falls vertically. The touchdown bonus should dominate
  continuous shaping rewards; otherwise passive falling can outscore a real
  landing strategy. Keep its physics, fitness shaping, slider tests, score
  metric tests, and champion compatibility tests in sync.
- Saved Flappy Bird champions are stored in `localStorage` under the historical
  `neuro-evolution-arcade.pipe-runner.champion`.
- The previous key `neuro-evolution-arcade.flappy.champion` and legacy key
  `ai-flappy-evolution.champion` should remain loadable while older browser
  saves may still exist.
- Saved Lunar Lander champions are stored under
  `neuro-evolution-arcade.lunar.champion`.

## Before Push Checklist

1. Run `npm run check`.
2. Confirm `git status --short` only contains intentional changes.
3. Commit with a focused message.
4. Push `main`.
5. Deploy to Vercel only when the user asks or when the change needs a live
   preview.
