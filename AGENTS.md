# AGENTS.md

## Project

Neuro Evolution Arcade is a static browser app for training neural-network
agents on small arcade games through neuroevolution. It currently includes
Pipe Runner and Snake, and the codebase should continue evolving as a
multi-game lab.

The app has no build step and no runtime dependencies. It is served directly
from `index.html`, `src/main.js`, and `src/styles.css`.

## Commands

Run this before every commit or push:

```bash
npm run check
```

This command runs:

- `node --check src/main.js`
- `npm test`

The test suite lives in `test/app.test.mjs` and uses Node's built-in
`node:test` runner with a lightweight DOM/canvas mock.

## Repository Layout

- `index.html`: app structure, controls, and explanatory content
- `src/main.js`: shared neuroevolution loop, game profiles, human mode,
  localStorage champion management, presets, and canvas drawing
- `src/styles.css`: responsive layout and control styling
- `test/app.test.mjs`: regression tests for the main app flows
- `README.md`: user-facing documentation and game roadmap

## Implementation Rules

- Keep the app dependency-free unless a feature clearly requires a package.
- Preserve static hosting compatibility. The app must still work by opening
  `index.html` or serving the folder with a static file server.
- Keep edits scoped. Avoid unrelated refactors when adding gameplay or UI
  features.
- Use ASCII in source files unless a file already requires non-ASCII text.
- If changing `src/main.js`, update or add tests in `test/app.test.mjs`.
- If adding a new control in `index.html`, add coverage that proves the control
  exists and affects app state.
- If changing neural-network shape, update:
  - `INPUTS`, `HIDDEN`, or genome sizing in `src/main.js`
  - network labels in `INPUT_LABELS`
  - champion compatibility tests
  - explanatory text in `index.html` and `README.md`

## Multi-Game Direction

Future games should be added as game profiles or modules with clear
boundaries:

- Game state and physics
- Agent input vector
- Action mapping
- Fitness function
- Rendering
- Human-control adapter, when applicable
- Tests for boot, controls, scoring, and reset behavior

Avoid hard-coding game-specific concepts into shared neuroevolution logic when
adding the next game. Pipe Runner and Snake now each define their own
observation vector, action mapping, fitness function, rendering, human controls,
and champion storage keys.

## Gameplay Notes

- AI training mode uses generations, fitness, selection, crossover, and
  mutation.
- Human play mode is intentionally one physics step per animation frame, even
  when the AI speed slider is higher. This keeps keyboard control playable.
- Game switching resets the current run and activates only the selected game's
  settings and explanation panel.
- Snake uses sequential evaluation. Only one specimen is active at a time; when
  it dies, the next specimen starts a fresh Snake board. The generation evolves
  only after every specimen has been evaluated.
- Snake's right-side controls intentionally differ from Pipe Runner: the metric
  label changes to `Specimen`, the speed slider has a higher maximum, and pipe
  presets are hidden.
- Pipe gap and pipe spacing reset the current run so one generation is not
  scored across mixed difficulty settings.
- Snake grid size and food patience reset the current Snake run for the same
  reason.
- Saved pipe-runner champions are stored in `localStorage` under
  `neuro-evolution-arcade.pipe-runner.champion`.
- The previous key `neuro-evolution-arcade.flappy.champion` and legacy key
  `ai-flappy-evolution.champion` should remain loadable while older browser
  saves may still exist.
- Saved Snake champions are stored under
  `neuro-evolution-arcade.snake.champion`.

## Before Push Checklist

1. Run `npm run check`.
2. Confirm `git status --short` only contains intentional changes.
3. Commit with a focused message.
4. Push `main`.
5. Deploy to Vercel only when the user asks or when the change needs a live
   preview.
